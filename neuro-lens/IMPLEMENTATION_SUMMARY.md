## 🔧 Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed FilesetResolver Path
**File:** `neuro-lens/src/components/CameraCanvas.tsx` (Line 45-46)
**Change:** Changed from CDN path to local path
```typescript
// Before (CDN)
const vision = await FilesetResolver.forVisionTasks(
  'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@mediapipe/tasks-vision@latest/wasm'
);

// After (Local)
const vision = await FilesetResolver.forVisionTasks('/mediapipe');
```

### 2. Fixed Camera Constraints
**File:** `neuro-lens/src/components/CameraCanvas.tsx` (Line 72-76)
**Change:** Changed from ideal dimensions to fixed 640x480
```typescript
// Before (Ideal dimensions)
video: {
  width: { ideal: width },
  height: { ideal: height },
  facingMode: 'user',
}

// After (Fixed dimensions)
video: {
  width: 640,
  height: 480,
  facingMode: 'user',
}
```

### 3. Added Offline WASM Assets
**Directory:** `neuro-lens/public/mediapipe/`
**Files Added:**
- `vision_wasm_internal.wasm` (9.1MB)
- `vision_wasm_nosimd_internal.wasm` (9.0MB)

**Script Created:** `neuro-lens/scripts/extract-wasm.js`
- Automatically extracts WASM files from `@mediapipe/tasks-vision` package
- Copies them to `public/mediapipe/` directory
- Added as `postinstall` script for automatic execution

### 4. Enhanced Package.json Scripts
**Added Scripts:**
- `npm run extract-wasm` - Manually extract WASM files
- `npm run verify` - Verify implementation completeness
- `postinstall` - Automatically extract WASM files after npm install

## 🚀 Runtime Testing Instructions

### 7-Step Manual Test Plan

1. **Start dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to /assessments:**
   - Open browser to `http://localhost:3000/assessments`
   - Verify "Live Preview" section is visible

3. **Grant camera permissions:**
   - Click "Show Preview" button
   - Allow camera access when prompted
   - Verify video stream starts

4. **Toggle overlay:**
   - Click "Hide Overlay" button - landmarks should disappear
   - Click "Show Overlay" button - landmarks should reappear
   - Verify toggle works correctly

5. **Observe quality chip switching:**
   - **Red state:** Move out of camera view or cover camera
   - **Amber state:** Move slowly or partially out of view
   - **Green state:** Stay still in center of camera view
   - Verify chip updates live with color and score changes

6. **FPS check:**
   - Look at FPS badge in top-right corner
   - Should show 20-30 FPS during normal operation
   - Note any performance issues

7. **Performance verification:**
   - Check browser console for any errors
   - Verify smooth landmark tracking
   - Test overlay toggle responsiveness

## 📊 Performance Characteristics

- **Expected FPS Range:** 20-30 FPS during normal operation
- **Model Size:** 5.5MB (pose_landmarker_lite.task)
- **WASM Assets:** 18.1MB total (2 files)
- **Camera Resolution:** Fixed 640x480 for optimal performance
- **Smoothing:** One-Euro filter + EMA smoother for stable tracking

## 🔒 Offline Capabilities

The system now works completely offline:
- ✅ WASM files hosted locally in `/public/mediapipe/`
- ✅ Pose model hosted locally
- ✅ No CDN dependencies
- ✅ Proper caching configuration in Next.js

## 🧪 Verification Tools

### Automated Verification
```bash
npm run verify
```
Runs comprehensive checks for all implementation requirements.

### Manual Verification
```bash
npm run extract-wasm
```
Manually extracts WASM files if needed.
